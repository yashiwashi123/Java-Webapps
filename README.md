## Learned about Java Servlets and JSP's ##

In this repository I have a Picture Ranker WebApp that allows users to create accounts, log in, and rank a series of pictures. The ranks of the pictures get stored in MySQL.  The average ranking of each picture is displayed on each picture's individual page. 

Additionally, I have a directory with a lot of little bits of code that are essentially the building blocks of making web apps with Java
